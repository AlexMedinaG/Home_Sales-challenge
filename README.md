# Home_Sales-challenge

The challenge was done in google colab because I was not able to run this on my local machine. 
 
For this challenge I was given a database for home sales and was asked some questions regarding the data; using SQL syntax I was able to answer them. 
The challenge also dealt with creating a Spark session, creating a temp view, a cache view, a partition, and have a view uncached.
